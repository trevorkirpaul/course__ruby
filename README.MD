# Notes
## from a [course on Ruby](https://www.udemy.com/comprehensive-ruby-programming-tutorial/)

Ruby has been very fun to code in so far! I've been taking this course because I believe learning a second language will help me become a better Javascript developer and a better dev in general.

I'll be taking this language much more slowly, focussing on basic concepts, which I know will translate well to other languages.

I was hesitant at first because I could have just spent this time on a Javascript course but I'm glad I followed through with Ruby.

Eventually I plan on replacing my full stack projects' backends with Ruby. Node.Js has been amazing and a great way for me to focus on Javascript as a beginner and I'll still keep it an option in the future.

After this course I'm planning on creating a Line Messenger app bot for a small group of friends. Then I'll either do a course on RoR or just start using a framework and create a backend server for a future React project.

My main focus is still Javascript and I have so much to learn but I know that this time spent on Ruby will ultimately make me a greater developer.
